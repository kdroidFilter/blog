Hello! My name is Elyahou!

I am a passionate Kotlin, native Android, and Multiplatform developer, dedicated to creating innovative solutions and pushing the boundaries of modern development. I am certified by JetBrains for my expertise in SQL, whether for backend development or data analysis. Currently, I am working towards certifications in Kotlin for Android and backend development to further validate my skills. Over the years, I have gained recognition for launching a trial version of the **K-droid filter**.

I am also the creator of the following libraries:

- [ComposeNativeNotification](https://github.com/kdroidFilter/ComposeNativeNotification): A library for managing native notifications in Compose applications.
- [ComposeNativeTray](https://github.com/kdroidFilter/ComposeNativeTray): A library designed for seamless integration of system tray features in Compose applications.

About a year ago, I introduced the **K-droid filter**, a project close to my heart. You can explore its journey in detail on [this post](https://mitmachim.top/topic/63309/). Since its release, the post has accumulated around **3,000 comments** and over **400,000 views**, reflecting the strong support and interest from the community. This project has been a collective effort, supported by incredible volunteers and contributors who helped refine and perfect it over months. The filter aims to provide tools for secure and kosher smartphone usage while ensuring simplicity and flexibility in its installation and features.

I firmly believe that Kotlin is the best programming language ever created. It offers exceptional performance and, with Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), provides the perfect way to build truly multiplatform applications.

As a developer, I must admit that I don’t enjoy working on UI design. For me, the main priorities are clean code, solid architecture, and top-notch performance. I absolutely love it when everything runs blazing fast and smoothly. In general, I’m not drawn to developing applications where success is almost guaranteed. What truly excites me is achieving the impossible and creating what feels like magic.

This blog serves as a reflection of my journey and a space where I share insights, technical tips, and blueprints for future innovations. My goal is to inspire and engage developers by providing practical knowledge and creative ideas. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find value in my experiences!
