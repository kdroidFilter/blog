Hello! My name is Elyahou !

I am a Kotlin, native Android and Multiplatform developer, I am known in particular for having deployed a trial version of the K-droid filter, but also for having contributed to the Compose ecosystem for Desktop. 

This blog is a bit like a personal notepad in which I write my tips, or my design plans for my future programs.
